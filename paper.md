## Abstract

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently received a lot of attention for their capability of representation learning on non-Eucleidian feature spaces. Like traditional deep learning models, the representation power of GCNs also increase with the increasing number of layers. However, it also increases the difficulty associated with training such models. Deep GCNs suffer from issues like vanishing gradient or overfitting. In this paper, we explored skip connections in GCNs and propsoed a deep residual graph convolutional neural network for predicting node properties in a protein-protein interaction network. The proposed model is an improvement over traditional deep learing models and present state-of-the-art graph learning algorithms.
